## Text-Based Crypto Haven

This project provides a simple, mobile-first way to manage digital assets. Users can establish a secure wallet linked to their phone number, acquire and display unique digital collectibles, and store small amounts of cryptocurrency. The system hinges on a mobile browser interface and leverages text message verification along with a user-saved QR code for wallet recovery.
